Changes: Semantically, the WALS has not been changed upon incorporation into this software package. What has been done is to collate all the various data files WALS provides (on languages, on features, on geographical information...) into a single data frame that supplies the entire atlas in one place, and enhance this with functions that assist in accessing the data in the atlas.
